# agriculture_crop_yield_intervention_analysis_in_R



In this project, we use **linear models** in R to model sugarcane yields, specifically sugarcane production and sugar content, of a sugar agriculture company. We then evaluate the models to determine if there are **possible interventions** to improve crop yield.
